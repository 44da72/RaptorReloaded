RaptorReloaded
==============

The Raptor Reloadd is an assistive device synthesized from designs and feedback from the e-NABLE community.  The philosophy and motivation behind this design is to lower the barrier to contribution and collaboration.  By making source files available in a variety of established and standard formats, we are making it easier for community members to test ideas using the modular and well-documented Raptor Reloaded design.  ï»¿

The files in this repo are the static release files and will be updated periodically to incorporate improvements generated by the community.
